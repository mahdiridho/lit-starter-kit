Lit App Toolbox - Starter Kit

Inspired by Polymer Starter Kit, I would love to share my fun one project to get you start the Lit based app easily. 

It's already support to router, state management, and pwa set.

I adjust the rollup config from @open-wc to perform pwa builder best practice where we will get the service worker with auto cache update.
